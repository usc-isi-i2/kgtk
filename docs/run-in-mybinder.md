### Try KGTK Online with MyBinder
The easiest, no-cost way of trying out KGTK is through [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/). We have made available several **example notebooks** to show some of the \
features of KGTK, which can be run in two environments:

* **Basic KGTK functionality**: This notebook may take **5-10 minutes** to launch, please be patient. Note that in this notebook some KGTK commands (graph analytic\
s and embeddings) **will not run**. To launch the notebook in your browser, click on the "Binder" icon: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://my\
binder.org/v2/gh/usc-isi-i2/kgtk/master?filepath=examples%2FExample5%20-%20AIDA%20AIF.ipynb)

* **Advanced KGTK functionality**: This notebook may take **10-20 minutes to launch**. It includes basic KGTK functionality and **graph analytics and embedding cap\
abilities** of KGTK:  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dgarijo/kgtk/dev?filepath=%2Fkgtk%2Fexamples%2FCSKG%20Use%20Case.\
ipynb)

For executing KGTK with large datasets, **we recommend a Docker/local installation**.
