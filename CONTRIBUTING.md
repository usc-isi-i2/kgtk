# How to contribute to the Knowledge Graph Toolkit

Third-party contributions are welcome to keep improving KGTK and support 
additional features. In order to include new contributions, please follow 
the guidelines below.

## Before you start
Please check the open issues related to your contribution, as your contribution
may be under discussion.

## Making changes

* Create a new branch with the new feature or bug you are addressing. Please try 
to keep features modular.
  * Clone the `dev` branch, as it is the most updated one in the repository.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Do pull requests **only** against the `dev` branch. Please avoid working directly
on the `main` branch.
  * Specify which issues does your pull request address.
